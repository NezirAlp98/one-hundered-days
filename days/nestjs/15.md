# Day 15: Auth Review & Refinement

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Review Your Auth System:** Go over the entire authentication and authorization flow you have built.
2.  **Refactor and Clean Up:** Clean up your code, ensuring that it is well-structured and easy to understand.
3.  **Consider Refresh Tokens:** Research the concept of refresh tokens and think about how you might implement them to improve security.
4.  **Test All Auth Endpoints:** Use an API client to thoroughly test your login endpoint and all protected routes, including RBAC.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Today is about consolidating your knowledge of authentication and authorization. You will review the system you have built, ensuring that it is robust and secure. You will also take some time to research more advanced topics like refresh tokens, which are used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again. This will give you a more complete picture of a production-ready authentication system.

## 💡 What You'll Gain
