# Day 11: Authentication with Passport.js

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Authentication Concepts:** Learn about authentication, authorization, and the role of Passport.js.
2.  **Install Passport and Strategy:** Install `@nestjs/passport`, `passport`, and `passport-local`.
3.  **Implement a Local Strategy:** Create a `LocalStrategy` to validate a user's credentials (e.g., username and password).
4.  **Protect an Endpoint:** Use the `AuthGuard` to protect a route and test your local authentication.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is. Today, you will take the first step in securing your application by implementing a basic username and password authentication system. You will use Passport.js, the most popular authentication middleware for Node.js, and its NestJS integration. The `passport-local` strategy is perfect for handling traditional credential-based logins.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to implement a foundational piece of any secure application: user authentication. You will understand how to use Passport.js strategies within NestJS to validate user credentials.
