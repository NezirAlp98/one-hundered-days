# Day 13: Guards for Authorization

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Guards:** Learn how Guards work in NestJS and their role in the request lifecycle.
2.  **Use the `AuthGuard`:** Apply the `AuthGuard('jwt')` to various endpoints to protect them.
3.  **Access the User Object:** Learn how to access the user object that is attached to the request by the `JwtStrategy`.
4.  **Create a Custom Guard:** Try creating a simple custom guard to understand the underlying mechanism.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Guards are a powerful feature in NestJS that determine whether a given request will be handled by the route handler or not. They are the perfect place to handle authorization logic. Today, you will use the built-in `AuthGuard` to protect your endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated users can access them. You will also learn how to access the authenticated user's information in your controllers.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will have a solid understanding of how to protect your API endpoints and implement authorization checks. You will be able to create both simple and complex authorization rules using Guards.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **Guard:** A class that implements the `CanActivate` interface and is used to protect routes.
*   **`CanActivate`:** An interface that a Guard must implement. It has a single method, `canActivate()`, which returns a boolean or a Promise/Observable of a boolean.
*   **`AuthGuard`:** A built-in Guard provided by `@nestjs/passport` that automatically invokes the appropriate Passport strategy.
