# Day 16: Configuration Management

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Install the Config Module:** Install the `@nestjs/config` library.
2.  **Create a `.env` File:** Create a `.env` file to store your application's configuration, such as database credentials and JWT secrets.
3.  **Load Configuration:** Use the `ConfigModule` to load and parse your `.env` file.
4.  **Access Configuration:** Inject the `ConfigService` into your modules and services to access your configuration values in a type-safe way.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Properly managing configuration is essential for building applications that can be deployed to different environments. Hardcoding values like database passwords or API keys is a major security risk. Today, you will learn how to use the official `@nestjs/config` module to manage your application's configuration using environment variables. This allows you to keep your sensitive data out of your source code and easily change configuration between development, staging, and production.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn a best-practice approach to managing configuration in a NestJS application. This will make your applications more secure, flexible, and easier to deploy.
