## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand E2E Testing:** Learn the difference between unit testing and end-to-end testing.
2.  **Explore the E2E Testing Setup:** Examine the default E2E testing setup in your NestJS project, which uses Supertest.
3.  **Write an E2E Test for a CRUD Flow:** Write a test that covers the entire lifecycle of a resource: creating it, reading it, updating it, and deleting it.

## 📖 Task Explanations

End-to-end (E2E) tests are designed to test your application as a whole, from the incoming request to the database and back. They are a crucial part of ensuring that all the different parts of your application are working together correctly. NestJS provides a convenient environment for E2E testing using Supertest. Today, you will learn how to write E2E tests that simulate real user interactions with your API.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will be able to write comprehensive E2E tests for your NestJS applications. This will give you the highest level of confidence that your application is working as expected from start to finish.
