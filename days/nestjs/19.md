# Day 19: Unit Testing

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand Unit Testing:** Learn the principles of unit testing and its importance in software development.
2.  **Set Up the Testing Environment:** Explore the default testing setup that comes with a new NestJS project (Jest).
3.  **Write Unit Tests for a Service:** Write tests for the methods in one of your services, mocking any dependencies.
4.  **Write Unit Tests for a Controller:** Write tests for your controller, mocking the service it depends on to isolate the controller's logic.

## 📖 Task Explanations

Testing is a critical part of building reliable and maintainable software. Unit tests allow you to verify that individual parts of your application are working correctly in isolation. NestJS comes with a robust testing environment built on Jest. Today, you will learn how to write unit tests for your services and controllers, including how to mock dependencies to ensure that your tests are fast and reliable.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to write effective unit tests for your NestJS applications. This will improve the quality of your code and give you the confidence to make changes without breaking existing functionality.
