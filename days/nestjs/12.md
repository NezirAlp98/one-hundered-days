# Day 12: JWT for Stateless Authentication

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Understand JWT:** Learn what JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are and why they are used for stateless authentication.
2.  **Install JWT Module:** Install `@nestjs/jwt`.
3.  **Generate Tokens:** Upon successful login, generate a JWT for the user.
4.  **Implement a JWT Strategy:** Create a `JwtStrategy` to validate incoming JWTs and extract the user payload.

## 📖 Task Explanations

JWTs are a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. They are commonly used for stateless authentication, meaning the server does not need to store session information. Today, you will refactor your authentication logic to issue a JWT upon login. You will then create a strategy to protect your endpoints by validating this token on every request.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will be able to implement a modern, stateless authentication system using JWT. This is a highly valuable skill for building scalable and secure APIs.

## 📚 Dictionary for Developers

*   **JWT (JSON Web Token):** A standard for creating access tokens that assert some number of claims.
*   **Stateless Authentication:** An authentication scheme where the server does not need to store any session information about the user.
*   **Payload:** The data stored inside a JWT, which typically includes user information and token expiration.
*   **`@nestjs/jwt`:** The official NestJS library for working with JWTs.
