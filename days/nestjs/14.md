# Day 14: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## 📝 Today's Tasks

1.  **Implement Roles:** Add a `roles` property to your `User` entity (e.g., 'admin', 'user').
2.  **Create a `Roles` Decorator:** Create a custom decorator to specify the required roles for a route.
3.  **Create a `RolesGuard`:** Build a Guard that checks if the authenticated user has the required role to access an endpoint.
4.  **Apply RBAC:** Protect certain endpoints so that they can only be accessed by users with a specific role (e.g., an admin-only endpoint).

## 📖 Task Explanations

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a common authorization pattern where permissions are associated with roles, and users are assigned to roles. Today, you will build a flexible RBAC system from scratch. You will create a custom decorator to declare the roles required for a route and a `RolesGuard` to enforce those rules. This will give you fine-grained control over what different types of users can do in your application.

## 💡 What You'll Gain

You will learn how to implement a powerful and flexible authorization system. This is a critical skill for building multi-tenant or complex applications with different user permission levels.
